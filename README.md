# Lyrics Capitalization Script

This Python script capitalizes the first letter of each word in multiple sample texts and writes the results to a file. It uses text samples from the `lyrics` module and processes each one to ensure proper capitalization.

## Features

- **Capitalization:** Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the provided text samples.
- **File Output:** Writes the capitalized text to a file, separating each sample with a newline.

## Requirements

This script requires Python to run. Additionally, you need to have a module named `lyrics` that contains the sample texts (`lyrics.x1`, `lyrics.x2`, `lyrics.x3`, and `lyrics.x4`).

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment**

   Ensure you have Python installed. You also need to have the `lyrics` module that contains the sample texts. Make sure this module is accessible in your Python environment.

2. **Download the Script**

   To get the latest version of the script, clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashank2043/capitalizer.git
This will download the script and other relevant files from the repository to your local machine.

3. **Run the Script**
   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
This will process the sample texts, capitalize each word, and save the output to result.txt. It will also print the results to the console.
